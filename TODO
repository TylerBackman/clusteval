Do a git commit.
Build R documentation and package
Reboot and do trial run again for q = 5 and B = 5.
Then try all other data sets with q = 5 and B = 5.
Update all data sets to q = 200, B = 100, num_clusters = 3:7, and
	cl_methods <- c("hierarchical", "kmeans", "pam", "model", "diana")
	similarity_methods <- c("rand", "jaccard", "adjustedrand")
Run them!



Add bootstrap_type argument to clustomit_landon
	Should be in: c("nonparametric, parametric")
	If nonparametric, use what we already have. with_replacement only affects this.
	If parametric, use the method in section 3.3 in Hennig
		An additional argument should be added to clustomit_landon that is a RNG function that matches the
			criteria in 'boot'
		If it is NULL, we use the one in Hennig.
		This should allow additional support for other types of parametric bootstrapping/jittering
			such as the one we used in the original paper.

Once I figure out what a good value for B (the bootstrap replicates) is, update the default values
	for each of the clustomit functions




Add more documentation to clustomit_boot
Add documentation to helper functions.

Make sure the WARNINGS being thrown by the similarity functions is not critical.
	Fix it, if possible.
