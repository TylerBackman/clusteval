Finish Unit Test #2 for consensus clustering
Implement functions to generate from each family of distributions:
  - Multivariate Gamma
Create graphical outputs for each of FOM, clusterboot, and clustomit for each family of distributions:
  - Bivariate Uniform
  - Multivariate Normal
  - Multivariate Student's t
  - Multivariate Gamma
Add package level documentation to clustomit
Add data sets for each data set in the package:
  - St. Jude
  - SRBCT
Add documentation for each data set in clustomit:
  - St. Jude
  - SRBCT
  - For an example, see:
    - https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki/docs-function
Copy and paste sim writeups and graphical figure code to webnotebook
Add 'clusteval' package to PNNL's version of the CRAN repository
Add error checking for positive sample sizes to:
  - Bivariate Uniform
  - Multivariate Normal
  - Multivariate Student's t
  - Multivariate Gamma
Add unit test to check the errors for each of:
  - Bivariate Uniform
  - Multivariate Normal
  - Multivariate Student's t
  - Multivariate Gamma
Add unit test to verify proper output of:
  - Bivariate Uniform
  - Multivariate Normal
  - Multivariate Student's t
  - Multivariate Gamma







Ensure that the licensing for 'mclust' does not create an issue with our R package.
Add/update data-microarray with data sets
Summarize data graphically
	Handle NAs
It would be useful to consider an external validation approach here as well.
	Rather than using a clustering method to get the truth, use the true, external
	labels to see how well the method could match it.
Consider using 'clara' as a clustering method. To quote Hennig's documentation,
	"PAM is better, CLARA is faster"
	If this is true, then CLARA may yield results that we can criticize.
Add bootstrap_type argument to clustomit_landon
	Should be in: c("nonparametric, parametric")
	If nonparametric, use what we already have. with_replacement only affects this.
	If parametric, use the method in section 3.3 in Hennig
		An additional argument should be added to clustomit_landon that is a RNG function that matches the
			criteria in 'boot'
		If it is NULL, we use the one in Hennig.
		This should allow additional support for other types of parametric bootstrapping/jittering
			such as the one we used in the original paper.
Add more documentation to clustomit_boot
Add documentation to helper functions.
Make sure the WARNINGS being thrown by the similarity functions is not critical.
	Fix it, if possible.
