* Fix Errors

I'm getting the following two errors in the second artificial data set with K = 3:

Warning messages:
1: In FUN(c(3L, 2L, 1L)[[3L]], ...) :
  Error in clustomit_boot: number of cluster centres must lie between 1 and nrow(x)
Number of Rows in x: 2
Number of Clusters: 2
2: In FUN(c(3L, 2L, 1L)[[3L]], ...) :
  Error in clustomit_boot: more cluster centers than distinct data points.
Number of Rows in x: 1

Let's call the messages #1 and #2.

It seems quite possible that message #1 can occur often, such as there are K - 1
extreme outliers and the other cluster is omitted.

** TODO For this case, the Jaccard coefficient must be zero. Return this automatically.

For message #2, I don't see how this is possible. This must be a bug.

** TODO Determine when and why message #2 is occurring. Squash it.

For now, I should probably remove the try call. Then, use one of the R debugging methods, such
as trace().

** TODO After bugs are squashed. Alter the error message in clustomit_boot.

* ClustOmit SimDesign for Testing

J = Jaccard
CR = Completely Random with equal a priori probabilities
COS = Cluster Omission Stability statistic

** TODO For each SimDesign, manually calculate:
    E_CR[COS] = 1/(M-1) (?)
    V_CR[COS] = ?
** TODO For each simulation, check that the average simulated COS score is very close to the E_CR[COS]
    By close, I mean with 3 standard deviations

** TODO Error Checking
*** TODO Add DEBUG = T/F option
*** TODO If DEBUG = TRUE:
    Use try() to save results for every iteration to determine which index fails.
    For each iteration, save every detail, including RNG seed and generated data
*** TODO Write script to parse output and objects to summarize state during error.
*** TODO Fix error
*** TODO Add problem case as a unit test.

* Clustering Wrappers
** Determine the common items that each clustering algorithm should return

Obviously, the cluster labels should be returned. But there should be some conditional items that should be returned, such
as cluster membership posterior probabilities if available (fuzzy labels). Obviously, there will be the actual object returned
by the clustering algorithm. Because this can be quite large, this should only be stored if the user sets the flag to do so.
By default, this should be stored, so that out of the box, things are handled as expected. But this should be turned off
because the storage can be quite overwhelming for a large number of clustering algorithms and/or large data sets.

See the 'caret' package for a lookup table of available features for each clustering algorithm.
